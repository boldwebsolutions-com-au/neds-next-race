# Next To Jump - Neds

This react app displays the next 5 races to jump using the 'nextraces' API. Each of the races are displayed with their meeting name and race number, along with type of race (Horses, Greyhounds, Harness). There is a countdown timer that goes until - 1min and then the race is removed from the UI.

There is also the ability to filter by race type.

## Future Scope

There is plenty of additional information available on this endpoint, such as best bets, weather condition and track information. This information could be helpful to a user and should be considered to be added within the UI.

Also, linking directly to the race to allow the user to bet is also a cruicial missing part.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
